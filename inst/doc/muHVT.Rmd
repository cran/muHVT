# Abstract


The muHVT package is a collection of R functions for vector quantization and
construction of hierarchical Voronoi tessellations as a data visualization
tool to visualize cells using quantization. The hierarchical cells are computed using
Hierarchical K-means where a quantization threshold governs the levels
in the hierarchy for a set $k$ parameter (the maximum number of cells
at each level). The package is particularly helpful to visualize rich multivariate data. 


This package additionally provides functions for computing the
Sammonâ€™s projection and plotting the heat map of the variables on the tiles of the tessellations.

The muHVT process involves three steps:

1. **Compress:** Using a quantization threshold
2. **Project:** Using a dimension projection algorithm
3. **Tessellate:** Using a Voronoi Tessellation
